<p>If you want to¬†<strong><span style="color:#3e960f;" class="has-inline-color">do</span></strong>¬†something, but you&#8217;re¬†<strong><span style="color:#bd0a0d;" class="has-inline-color">stuck</span></strong> it might be because you lack¬†<strong><strong>clarity</strong></strong>¬†about the exact¬†<strong>outcome</strong>¬†you&#8217;d like to make happen and the concrete¬†<strong>action</strong>¬†you need to take to get there.</p>



<p><strong>When?</strong></p>



<p>It might be when you&#8217;re spinning your wheels on your own &#8230;</p>



<p>&#8230; or when you&#8217;re caught in an endless planning meeting.</p>



<p>Either way clarifying can help.</p>



<p><strong>Clarify</strong>&nbsp;to reduce the risk of unpleasant surprises ‚Äî if things are unclear, you&#8217;re unlikely to get what you want.</p>



<p><strong>Clarify</strong>&nbsp;to get unstuck&nbsp;‚Äî ambiguity is a major driver of procrastination.</p>



<p><strong>How?</strong></p>



<p>First&nbsp;<strong>clarify the outcome</strong>:</p>



<p>Pick a topic that&#8217;s important to you and let&#8217;s do it right now.</p>



<p>Question 1:&nbsp;<em>And what would you&nbsp;<strong>like to have happen</strong></em>?</p>



<p>Your answer: &#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.</p>



<p>Question 2:&nbsp;<em><strong>How will you know</strong>&nbsp;that it happened</em>?</p>



<p>Describe direct sensory experiences. What will you be able to&nbsp;<strong>see</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>hear</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>touch</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>smell</strong>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<strong>taste</strong>?</p>



<p>This sounds simple, but it can be surprisingly hard. Our heads are full of abstract concepts that we equate with reality and we don&#8217;t often look at the world without that lense. And while all those concepts are essential for us to function in the world, it&#8217;s a powerful skill to be able to look at the ground reality beneath.</p>



<p>For example:</p>



<p>I want to improve usability.</p>



<p>I will know I have improved usability when the system is easier to use.</p>



<p>What does&nbsp;<em>easier</em>&nbsp;look like? What does it sound like? Can you touch easier? Can you smell it?!</p>



<p>How about: Given a task and 5 users, at least 4 of them complete the task within 10 seconds.</p>



<p>Now that&#8217;s something you can&nbsp;<em>see</em>. Start the clock. Go. Task complete. Where is the seconds hand?</p>



<p>It might feel pedantic at first ‚Äî but I promise ‚Äî it&nbsp;<em>will</em>&nbsp;pay dividends.</p>



<p>Ok, back to your topic: How will you know that it happened?</p>



<p>Your answer: &#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.</p>



<p>Finally we&#8217;re ready for question 3:&nbsp;<em><strong>Why is this important&nbsp;</strong>to you</em>?</p>



<p>A key part to provide motivation for actually following through with the plan.</p>



<p>Or deciding it&#8217;s not worth doing after all!</p>



<p>Your answer: &#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.</p>



<p>Then&nbsp;<strong>clarify the action:</strong></p>



<p>It should be pretty easy now.</p>



<p>In a group context ask:&nbsp;<em>Who? What? When?</em></p>



<p>In an individual context ask:&nbsp;<em>What is the next concrete action I need to take?</em></p>



<p>Your answer:&nbsp;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.</p>



<p>Clear?</p>



<p>Go on, do it <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f642.png" alt="üôÇ" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Kanban people remind us to&nbsp;<strong>visualize work</strong>.</p>



<p>The default example is a board full of cards that represent tasks and their status.</p>



<p>Something like this:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/omt-17-visualize-work.jpg"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/omt-17-visualize-work.jpg?w=638" alt="" class="wp-image-2533" width="319" height="179" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/omt-17-visualize-work.jpg 638w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/10/omt-17-visualize-work-300x169.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 319px) 100vw, 319px" /></a></figure>



<p>That is a powerful tactic and we will surely explore it in future posts.</p>



<p>But now I want to start with something a little different:</p>



<p><strong>Visualize the outcomes your work is intended to deliver</strong>, not just the work itself.</p>



<p>Both direct and indirect outcomes.</p>



<p><strong>Direct outcomes</strong>&nbsp;are the immediate results of your actions: for example the code you&#8217;ve written or the blog posts you&#8217;ve published.</p>



<p>Please note, it will be important soon: there&#8217;s minimal uncertainty about the action =&gt; outcome connection.</p>



<p>Direct outcomes are one thing, but it&#8217;s the&nbsp;<strong>indirect outcomes</strong>&nbsp;that are what&nbsp;<em>really</em>&nbsp;counts.</p>



<p>Most people care less about the code you&#8217;ve written and more about the app it is running,</p>



<p>less about the raw text of your posts and more about the things they can learn from them.</p>



<p>The gold is burried in the&nbsp;<strong>human needs waiting to be served by the (indirect) ourcomes of your work</strong>.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/omt-17-needs.jpg"><img decoding="async" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/omt-17-needs.jpg?w=683" alt="" class="wp-image-2532" width="242" height="341" /></a></figure>



<p>The only problem is that the connection between action and indirect outcomes is,&nbsp;well&#8230;&nbsp;<em>indirect</em>.</p>



<p>To achieve the really important indirect outcomes you need&nbsp;<strong>sustained action over time</strong></p>



<p>&#8230; and some&nbsp;<strong>feedback loops</strong>&nbsp;to correct course on your way.</p>



<p>It can be hard, but if you&nbsp;<strong>consistently&nbsp;keep your eyes on what matters most</strong>&nbsp;you are bound to achieve amazing results.</p>



<p>Go forth and visualize!</p>

<p>After&nbsp;<a href="https://remoteleader.substack.com/p/good-communication-is-concrete">concrete</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://remoteleader.substack.com/p/make-your-communication-concise">concise</a>, now is the time to cover the third part of the trilogy: meaningful.</p>



<p>Talk about&nbsp;<strong>what they care about&nbsp;</strong>‚Ä¶</p>



<p>‚Ä¶ using the&nbsp;<strong>same words they use</strong>&nbsp;to describe it.</p>



<p>Great, but how do we know what people care about?</p>



<p>Here are three ways: Listen, Ask and Observe.</p>



<p>1)&nbsp;<strong>Listen</strong></p>



<p>Many people love to talk, especially if they feel you‚Äôre listening.</p>



<p>They will happily give you a lot of useful information.</p>



<p>Don‚Äôt interrupt them.</p>



<p>Pay high quality attention to what they‚Äôre saying (or writing).</p>



<p>Notice how they‚Äôre describing the situation (<strong>what is</strong>), the problem (<strong>what they don‚Äôt want</strong>) and the desired outcome (<strong>what they do want</strong>).</p>



<p>Note the&nbsp;<strong>exact words</strong>&nbsp;they‚Äôre using.</p>



<p><strong>Take notes</strong>&nbsp;and refer to them when you‚Äôre preparing your own message.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator" />



<p>2)&nbsp;<strong>Ask</strong></p>



<p>You can also nudge your conversation partner to explore their thinking more.</p>



<p>About the situation and the problem you can ask:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>‚Äú<em>What is that like?</em>‚Äù,</li><li>‚Äú<em>What‚Äôs the most important thing about this?</em>‚Äù,</li><li>‚Äú<em>And what happens then?</em>‚Äú</li></ul>



<p>When they tell you about a problem, resist the urge to offer solutions.</p>



<p>First turn the conversation towards desired outcomes by asking:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>‚Äú<em>And what would you like to have happen?</em>‚Äù</li></ul>



<p>Listen and explore some more.</p>



<p>In this whole process don‚Äôt ask too many questions at once.</p>



<p>Ask one question and immediately switch back to high quality listening.</p>



<p>Now you know a lot more about what people care about and you have a much higher chance of making your own communication much more meaningful.</p>



<p>To them.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator" />



<p>3)&nbsp;<strong>Observe</strong></p>



<p>Sometimes people are not ready to tell you their deepest thoughts and desires.</p>



<p>Sometimes they might not be sure themselves.</p>



<p>The fallback solution it to also&nbsp;<strong>observe what they actually do</strong>&nbsp;in key situations.</p>



<p>That can often tell you a lot about what might be meaningful to that person.</p>



<p>Update your assumptions accordingly.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator" />



<p>That‚Äôs it.</p>



<p>1-2-3.</p>



<p>Listen-Ask-Observe.</p>



<p>Try for yourself and tell me your story!</p>



<p>See you soon,</p>



<p>Micha≈Ç</p>

<p><em>Use the pyramid principle</em></p>



<p>Last week&nbsp;<a href="https://remoteleader.substack.com/p/good-communication-is-concrete">we covered the first C of good communication: Concrete</a></p>



<p>Today it‚Äôs time for the second C:&nbsp;<strong>Concise</strong></p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator" />



<p>1) The best way to make your communication concise is to&nbsp;<strong>start with your main point</strong>.</p>



<p>Add details, supporting arguments and the steps you took to come up with your main point&nbsp;<strong>only as much as necessary to inform or influence</strong>.</p>



<p>One way to think about it is as&nbsp;<strong>the pyramid principle</strong>:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list"><li>main point at the top</li><li>supporting information below</li></ol>



<p>Americans have a related saying: ‚Äú<em>don‚Äôt sell past the close</em>‚Äù.</p>



<p>If the customer is ready to buy &#8211; close the sale &#8211; if you continue talking, all you‚Äôre doing is risk losing them.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator" />



<p>2) The other thing you should do is to<strong>&nbsp;delete stuff that does not contribute</strong>&nbsp;to the purpose of the communication.</p>



<p>It might seem that adding arguments or information will increase effectiveness, but I‚Äôd bet that you are severely overestimating people‚Äôs&nbsp;<strong>available mental bandwidth</strong>.</p>



<p>Even if you‚Äôre dealing with highly intelligent people &#8211; it‚Äôs very likely they have a lot on their plate &#8211; and if you dump a bunch of information that is not immediately relevant to them they will likely lose interest in whatever it is you‚Äôre trying to tell them.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator" />



<p>When you type up your next draft message (incl. notes for a presentation or meeting):</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list"><li>reorder stuff to put the main point first</li><li>remove stuff that does not contribute enough</li><li>‚Ä¶</li><li>profit</li></ol>



<p>See you soon!</p>



<p>PS. If you‚Äôve found this tip useful please share it on Social Media adding your own comment on top. The habit of sharing things you have learned will reinforce your own knowledge and will contribute to your image as a helpful expert.</p>



<p>Also: the picture will look good in your feed!</p>

<p>In the previous One Minute Tip we covered one of the&nbsp;<strong>three key skills of remote work</strong>, namely to&nbsp;<a href="https://remoteleader.substack.com/p/communicate-well-in-short-chunks">communicate well in short chunks of writing</a>.</p>



<p>We ended that tip with the statement that&nbsp;<strong>good communication is CCM</strong>:&nbsp;<strong>concrete</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>concise</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>meaningful</strong>.</p>



<p>Now we will make that tip more&nbsp;<em>concrete</em>.</p>



<p>My favorite ways to make communication more concrete are:</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator" />



<p>1)&nbsp;<a href="https://remoteleader.substack.com/p/show-it">Show, don‚Äôt tell</a>&nbsp;(covered in the very first One Minute Tip):</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>in meetings: whenever you talk about something ‚Äî&nbsp;<strong>share your screen and show it</strong>, if it doesn‚Äôt exist yet ‚Äî create it (at least give it a name and address and some initial notes to be developed later),</li><li>in text: whenever you mention something ‚Äî<strong>&nbsp;link to it</strong>.</li></ul>



<hr class="wp-block-separator" />



<p>2) If the communication is related to some kind of action or event ‚Äî make sure there are clear answers to the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_Ws">five core journalistic questions</a>:&nbsp;<strong>Who? What? When? Where?</strong>and&nbsp;<strong>Why?</strong>&nbsp;(for what purpose) as well as the bonus question&nbsp;<strong>How?</strong></p>



<p>Start with the top 3: Who? What? When?</p>



<p>Make it a habit.</p>



<p>Who, What, When</p>



<p>WhoWhatWhen</p>



<p>WHO WHAT WHEN<img decoding="async" src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb99a2a03-7867-4cb3-af5e-8279a00f3a45_1080x1080.png" alt="" style="width:500px;"></p>



<p>Not all communication requires this level of concreteness,</p>



<p>but if it‚Äôs missing</p>



<p>don‚Äôt expect conrete results.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator" />



<p>3) ‚Äú<em>When in doubt spell it out!</em>‚Äù</p>



<p>If you‚Äôre responsible for the work of more than one person you‚Äôre better off erring on the side of caution and over-communicating.</p>



<p>Make references concrete.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/">Explicit is better than implicit</a>.</p>



<p>Perhaps even say the same thing in a few different ways.</p>



<p>Here‚Äôs what I mean:</p>



<p><strong>bad</strong>: ‚Äú<em>let‚Äôs learn to communicate better</em>‚Äù (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wfq2YpcubSs">everyone agrees, and likely nothing will happen</a>)</p>



<p><strong>better</strong>: ‚Äú<em>let‚Äôs practice communicating better with short chunks of writing this Friday at 3pm on Zoom</em>‚Äù (concrete who, what, when / people might not be interested but at least it will be clear)</p>



<p><strong>best</strong>: ‚Äú<em>let‚Äôs practice&nbsp;<a href="https://remoteleader.substack.com/p/communicate-well-in-short-chunks">communicating better with short chunks of writing</a>&nbsp;this Friday at 3pm on Zoom</em>‚Äù (who what when &amp; a link to more information for the people who want it)</p>



<p>Try it!</p>



<p>PS. Next tip will be about how to make your communication&nbsp;<em>concise</em>.</p>



<p>PPS. If you like this series of tips, please share it with someone who might like it too!</p>

<p>One of the¬†<a href="https://fluidcircle.net/keyskills/">key skills of remote work</a>¬†is to¬†<strong>communicate well (in short chunks (of writing))</strong>.</p>



<p><img decoding="async" src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff819c4d8-907c-49e4-9df3-f21c9c25410f_433x349.jpeg" alt=""></p>



<p>Let me explain:</p>



<p><strong>Communicate well</strong></p>



<p>What counts as&nbsp;<em>communicating well</em>&nbsp;depends on the purpose:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list"><li>if it‚Äôs information ‚Äî is it easy to understand and relevant to what the audience cares about?</li><li>if the purpose is influence ‚Äî does it move people to action?</li><li>if it‚Äôs a question ‚Äî is easy to answer with the right information?</li></ol>



<p><strong>In short chunks</strong></p>



<p>Long-form communication is useful, but for effective remote work we must especially master communicating in short chunks.</p>



<p>It‚Äôs not only meaty articles, exhustive technical manuals or detailed presentations.</p>



<p>It‚Äôs a bunch of short snippets that contains the lifeblood of our daily interactions towards getting things done:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list"><li>clear and actionable e-mails,</li><li>chat messages that are easy to understand and respond to,</li><li>informative comments on work items,</li><li>as well as spoken statements during face to face conversations.</li></ol>



<p><strong>Of writing</strong></p>



<p>Meetings are still important, 1on1 video conversations do play a crucial role, recorded explanations are now super easy to record thanks to services like Loom.</p>



<p>But the bread and butter of remote communication is, and should be, written.</p>



<p>Prefereably&nbsp;<strong>captured</strong>&nbsp;in a transparent and reliable&nbsp;<strong>repository</strong>&nbsp;like Trello or a Wiki not a semi-ephemeral form like chat or email.</p>



<p><strong>Ok, but how?</strong></p>



<p>I like to think about making my communication CCM:</p>



<p>Concrete, Concise and Meaningful.</p>



<p>More concrete tips on how to do that are coming in the next several One Minute Tips, but for now:</p>



<p>How good is the communication you receive in your daily work?</p>



<p>Is it CCM?</p>



<p>How good is the communication you typically send (or speak)?</p>



<p>What might you be able to do if your communication skills improved significantly?</p>



<p>See you soon!</p>

<p><em>Live your differentiators</em></p>



<p>If you want to create a successful product or service a common piece of advice I hear is to ‚Äúwow‚Äù your customers.</p>



<p>To deliver such moments of sheer delight that they will never forget it.</p>



<p>If you‚Äôre a leader the same goes for creating a great employee experience.</p>



<p>This advice can be misleading.</p>



<p>One problem with ‚Äúwow‚Äù effects is due to a natural human mechanism of&nbsp;<em>hedonic adaptation</em>.</p>



<p>Humans get used to a new normal very quickly and come to seek out more and more&nbsp;<em>hits</em>&nbsp;of the&nbsp;<em>emotional high</em>&nbsp;that you were trying to target.</p>



<p>Don‚Äôt chase that high.</p>



<p>Instead ask yourself:</p>



<p><strong>What do I want my product or service to be&nbsp;</strong><em><strong>remembered for</strong></em><strong>?</strong></p>



<p>And don‚Äôt settle for generic statements like&nbsp;<em>high quality</em>.</p>



<p>Ask:&nbsp;<em>what kind</em>&nbsp;<em>of quality</em>?</p>



<p>Be specific.</p>



<p>I want _________ to be&nbsp;<em>remembered for</em>:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list"><li>__________________</li><li>__________________</li><li>__________________</li></ol>



<p>And when 1, 2, 3:&nbsp;<em>what happens then</em>?</p>



<p>______________________________________________________</p>



<p>______________________________________________________</p>



<p>______________________________________________________</p>



<p>What does that&nbsp;<em>look, sound and feel like</em>?</p>



<p>______________________________________________________</p>



<p>______________________________________________________</p>



<p>______________________________________________________</p>



<p>Now you‚Äôre ready to start&nbsp;<strong>putting that into practice</strong>.</p>



<p>And&nbsp;<strong>never stop</strong>.</p>



<p>You know you‚Äôre on the right track when people start¬†<strong>telling each others stories</strong>¬†about how you‚Äôre¬†<strong>consistently delivering</strong>¬†<em><strong>your kind</strong></em><strong>¬†of quality</strong>.</p>



<p><img decoding="async" src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4e462f74-b076-4790-ab7d-a649791bb135_1080x1080.png" alt="" style="width:500px;"></p>



<p>How would you describe the qualities of this newsletter?</p>



<p>Is it different in any way to what you‚Äôre used to?</p>



<p>Has it made a difference in&nbsp;<em>your</em>&nbsp;life?</p>



<p>Tell me your story!</p>

<p><em>Base key decision on estimated impact on quantified stakeholder values</em></p>



<p>Will your project succeed?</p>



<p>That question hangs on a simple commandment:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p>Make things people want.</p></blockquote>



<p>Great, but how do we know what people want?</p>



<p>This is definitely a difficult question,</p>



<p>but there‚Äôs a powerful technique that can help cut through ambiguity.</p>



<p>It is to&nbsp;<em><strong>quantify</strong></em><strong>&nbsp;the top 10 most important things</strong>&nbsp;for your project or product.</p>



<p>Express them as a number.</p>



<p>Clarify&nbsp;<strong>with your most important stakeholders</strong>&nbsp;that it‚Äôs actually what they had in mind.</p>



<p>And then&nbsp;<strong>estimate the impact of the options</strong>&nbsp;you‚Äôre considering on those values.</p>



<p>I promise you it will bring to the surface misunderstandings that might otherwise derail your whole initiative.<img decoding="async" src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd4d52cf2-f0bb-4d1e-af00-75ba6bb215c8_408x455.png" alt=""></p>



<p>Do this:</p>



<p>1. Bring your key&nbsp;<strong>stakeholders</strong>&nbsp;together.</p>



<p>2. Ask what they&nbsp;<strong>value</strong>&nbsp;most: what is most important for them.</p>



<p>Try to express it as a concrete number,</p>



<p>what will you actually be able to&nbsp;<strong>see or hear</strong>&nbsp;when you‚Äôre successful?</p>



<p>How much of that?</p>



<p>Got the list?</p>



<p>Great.</p>



<p>Now:</p>



<p>3. List your&nbsp;<strong>options</strong>: the projects or strategies you were considering.</p>



<p>4. Using your&nbsp;<em>collective best guess</em>: how big of an&nbsp;<strong>impact</strong>&nbsp;will that project or strategy have on each of the most important stakeholder values?</p>



<p>At what&nbsp;<em>cost</em>?</p>



<p>Of course you will not be sure at this point.</p>



<p>Don‚Äôt worry, we‚Äôll validate the assumptions later.</p>



<p>But some strategies will&nbsp;<em>obviously</em>&nbsp;not be reasonable.</p>



<p>Drop those.</p>



<p>Focus on the most promising ones.</p>



<p>Iterate in short cycles.</p>



<p>Try it and let me know how it goes for you!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Some people use&nbsp;<a href="https://trello.com/">Trello</a>&nbsp;as a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.personalkanban.com/personal-kanban-101">Kanban</a>&nbsp;board (i.e. a task management or workflow app) and that‚Äôs a great use for it.</p>



<p>A different way is to think about Trello as a&nbsp;<em>structured whiteboard</em>&nbsp;that you can use for online workshops or even distributed, asynchronous sense-making and problem solving.</p>



<p>Unlike a dedicated task management tool like JIRA, Trello is much more flexible in how you organize your columns and what you put in individual cards.</p>



<p>Unlike a dedicated whiteboard tool lika Jamboard, Miro or Mural, Trello allows for just enough structure that let‚Äôs you make sense of a large amount of items but is also easier to use for people who are new to it.</p>



<p>For example Trello cards are&nbsp;<em>individually adressable</em>. You can link directly to a specific idea that was born during a big workshop. You don‚Äôt have to wade through all the other stuff that happened there, but it is close by if you do need some context. A very important trait for integrating the stuff you do in Trello into the wider context of your team‚Äôs information flows.</p>



<p>Here‚Äôs a sneak peek at a part of the board that we used for a recent workshop about&nbsp;<a href="https://mailchi.mp/ba31a0915319/overload">reducing meeting overload</a>:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><a href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb7654ea1-a073-48c1-b36d-7db939c09cb2_1188x340.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img decoding="async" src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb7654ea1-a073-48c1-b36d-7db939c09cb2_1188x340.png" alt="" /></a></figure>



<p><a target="_blank" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb7654ea1-a073-48c1-b36d-7db939c09cb2_1188x340.png" rel="noreferrer noopener">Here‚Äôs a board used to collect and share a&nbsp;</a><a href="https://trello.com/b/OyCgpp2F/2020">catalog of great ideas collected over the whole year</a>&nbsp;by&nbsp;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/gavrilaandrei/">Andrei Gavrila</a>. Notice the amazing&nbsp;<em>scanability</em>&nbsp;of the ideas. I dare you to create a better summary in a regular blog post or wiki page:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><a href="https://trello.com/b/OyCgpp2F/2020" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img decoding="async" src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6de3ac9c-e967-42b6-a1f6-4ae1fecf1033_1428x639.png" alt="" /></a></figure>



<p><a target="_blank" href="https://trello.com/b/OyCgpp2F/2020" rel="noreferrer noopener">And finally here‚Äôs the article by&nbsp;</a><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/paulklipp/">Paul Klipp</a>&nbsp;that introduced me to the idea many years ago. It‚Äôs a description of&nbsp;<a href="http://paulklipp.com/blog/use-a-kanban-board-to-facilitate-remote-retrospectives/">how to use a Kanban board for remote retrospectives</a>.<img decoding="async" src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8728f8a1-73c7-4e87-a7e8-a0bd95836b47_1024x646.png" alt=""></p>



<p>It uses a different app called Kanbanery, but the same ideas can be easily used in Trello. Thanks Paul!</p>
